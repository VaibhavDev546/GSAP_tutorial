console.log(Boolean(null)); // false, because null is a falsy value in JavaScript. According to the specification, Boolean(null) should return false. This is because null is considered to be a "falsy" value, meaning that it is treated as false in a boolean context. Other falsy values in JavaScript include 0, "", NaN, and undefined.
